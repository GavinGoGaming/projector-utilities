# Projector Utilities
Yes, I know JetBrains projector is deprecated. So why dont I switch?

I specifically want an in-browser code experience such as GitPod or Codespaces but using IntelliJ IDEs.

## Usage
Install using your script in the install folder. `chmod` the script and run it.
Here's some predetermined script <--> cloud if you need it:

| Cloud IDE | Install Script |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub Codespaces | debian-based install script |
